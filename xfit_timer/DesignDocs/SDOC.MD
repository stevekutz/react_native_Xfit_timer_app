### Problem Statement

Common CrossFit exercise timers provide single common screen for interval and rest timers. Our app extends this concept to a complete workout with individual interval and rest timer screens for each exercise.

### Scope

- Must have:

    - Each individual exercise has separate timer for exercise and rest

    - Each timer has customizable countdown alert to indicate when timer will end(e.g. alert tone for each of the last 5 seconds of exercise, single alert tone at 10 seconds. etc.)

    - Individual exercise has Title, optional description & notes

    - Overall workout routine has CRUD functionality

    - Each screen has customizable color

    - Ability to select from several default alert tones

    - Motivational banners throughout routine

- Nice to have:

    - Modal to show how to do exercise(images, GIF, video)

    - Ability to upload custom alert tones

- Not in scope:
